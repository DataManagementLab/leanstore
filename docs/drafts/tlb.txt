Paging, Translation lookaside buffer (TLB) in long mode(x64)

https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=22330
Long mode has 48 bit virtual addresses, but 52 bit physical addresses.
Therefore, paging is required.

Current x64 implementations use 4 level for page

Address-space switch per process and not per thread
page size (page frame size) is 4KiB on rome


System calls don't flush TLB, because kernel uses another address space
