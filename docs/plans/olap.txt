OLAP:

* vectorization is preferable; memory bandwidth per core is limited on moden many core systems and
* what we call cascades and schemes nesting is kind of formalized in white-box compression model [2].
We still have to find a way to pre-compile efficient code to (de)compress, i.e squashing the tree into one function call.
* point lookups rarely pays off but predicate push-down must be efficient at possible, we need a solid plan on that count
* we should find a way to accelerate nesting

# Some notes on prediates push down
* TZT makes it feasible despite compression dictionary as we will only have to binray search and decompress string on-demand while searching for the integer code for
comparison.
